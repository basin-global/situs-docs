# Overview

In the face of rapid environmental, technological, and social change the SITUS Protocol reduces systematic risk to ensure resilience.

SITUS works across all scales, in any location, for place-based initiatives.

As a resilience [hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html), the protocol is open source, composable, interoperable, extensible, non-custodial, censorship resistant, and can be configured to be permissioned or permissionless.

There are four basic parts: groups, accounts, assets, and currency. All four together form ENSURANCE which ensures the benefits nature provides in perpetuity.&#x20;

Fun fact: Originally designed to scale climate and nature project development, SITUS has proven to be much more versatile.
