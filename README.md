# Overview

In the face of rapid environmental, technological, and social change the SITUS Protocol reduces systematic risk to ensure resilience.

SITUS works across all scales, in any location, for groups and individuals working on place-based initiatives.

Built as a resilience [hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html), the protocol is open source, composable, interoperable, non-custodial, censorship resistant, and can be configured to be permissioned or permissionless.

There are four basic parts: groups, accounts, assets, and currency.
