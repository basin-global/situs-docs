<summary>How does this fund on the ground nature &#x26; climate projects?</summary>

SITUS Protocol is based off the [RealValue of Natural Capital Framework](https://docs.basin.global/) from BASIN and has adopted BASIN's Ecological Ensurance model that funds 21 ecosystem services across 14 ecosystems utilizing real asset fundamentals.&#x20;

All funds in the SITUS Protocol transparently flow through and to onchain accounts that all have 0x addresses. The primary funding mechanisms, which any OG can utilize and are split between the OG and the protocol, are: a) ENSURANCE assets, b) SITUS accounts, and c) ENSURE, the nature-based currency.&#x20;

All accounts have transparent public viewing to see assets and currency in each account and other modules such as place, impact, and reputation that score each account based on certain metrics.

<summary>How is this different than a domain or website?</summary>

While names may resemble domains, they have nothing to do with DNS. They are unique onchain accounts solely controlled by the account owner and are transferable, salable, and burnable. These accounts can hold and transfer any type of value in the form of ERC721, ERC1155, and ERC20 assets. Accounts can be accessed and managed using any preferred method of connection to the Base Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain. They are not tied to any specific interface or provider and cannot be restricted or censored at the chain level.

<summary>Is this the same as ENS?</summary>

SITUS Onchain Accounts are similar to ENS (Ethereum Name Service) but not related. They are unique text based immutable names tied to an account ID (#) and a dedicated 0x address for each account. ENS names require annual renewals whereas SITUS Accounts are one-time purchase with no renewal fees. ENS names can easily be configured to work with SITUS accounts ie elk.basin is configured with elk.basin-protocol.eth.&#x20;
