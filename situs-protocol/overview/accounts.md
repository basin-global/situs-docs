# Accounts

Accounts are the "members" of the groups. Accounts can represent whatever the group wants them to whether it be people, places, projects, or purpose (ie species, impact, etc). Accounts are operated by the `holder` which can be the group or individuals. Accounts can hold and send any type of value.

All accounts are unique and have immutable `name`, `tokenId`, and `TBAccount` which is its own cross chain 0x wallet.&#x20;
