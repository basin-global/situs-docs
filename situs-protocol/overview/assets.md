# Assets

Assets are the non-fungible and semi-fungible types of value that Accounts hold and operate. Assets are `ERC-721` or `ERC-1155`.

## ENSURANCE

SITUS has adopted BASIN's [Ensurance](https://docs.basin.global/ensurance/critical-infrastructure) model to ensure nature and the benefits it provides. Certificates of Ensurance (`1155`) can be issued and created by OG's to fund their work. Ensurance assets can be held, sold, sent, swapped, converted, and burned.&#x20;

The primary goal of Ensurance is to put real assets that "contain" the stocks and flows of natural capital in to permanent protection.  These real assets are "owned" by the protocol and in turn support the holistic value of ENSURE, the nature-based currency.
