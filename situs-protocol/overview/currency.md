# Currency

Currency is fungible value that OG's wish to utilize for their mission. As `ERC-20`, currency can be utilized extensively in the DeFi ecosystem for mission based outcomes.

## ENSURE

ENSURE is the nature-based community currency of SITUS.

ENSURE is built on the premise that money, and the value thereof, should be based on what we as a society collectively value. Historically this was shells, tulip bulbs, coal, gold, oil etc. We believe the value of money should be based on fully functioning and thriving ecosystems full of biodiversity that supports well-being.

**ENSURE and ENSURANCE work together dynamically to ensure nature in perpetuity.  As stores of value and medium of exchange they are based on the stocks and flows of natural capital (units of account in $'s) and underlying the real assets.**
