# Groups

OG's aka Onchain Groups are any group organizing to create and actuate place-based resilience.

All OG's have a name identifier such as `.basin` or `.refi` where members have accounts like `elk.basin` or `node-name-here.refi.` Each OG is on its own contract, deployed from the SITUS factory, and owned by the group.

Groups are autonomous and can be operated as they see fit. OG's control functions on the contract such as `buyingEnabled`, `metadataAddress`, `minter`, `price`, `referral`,  `owner`, and others.

Groups are made up of Accounts.
